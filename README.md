# Pizza Sales Analysis with MySQL

This repository contains SQL queries to analyze pizza sales data. The analysis is divided into basic, intermediate, and advanced levels, covering various aspects of the dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis pertains to pizza sales and includes information on orders, pizza details, categories, sizes, and prices.

## Questions Covered

The SQL queries in this repository address the following questions:

### Basic

* Retrieve the total number of orders placed. [cite: 1]
* Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales. [cite: 1]
* Identify the highest-priced pizza. [cite: 1]
* Identify the most common pizza size ordered. [cite: 2]
* List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities. [cite: 2]

### Intermediate

* Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered. [cite: 3]
* Determine the distribution of orders by the hour of the day. [cite: 4]
* Join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas. [cite: 4]
* Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day. [cite: 5]
* Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue. [cite: 6]

### Advanced

* Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue. [cite: 7]
* Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time. [cite: 7]
* Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category. [cite: 8]

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

* `sql_scripts/`: This directory contains the SQL scripts for each question. Scripts are named according to the question number (e.g., `basic_1.sql`, `intermediate_4.sql`, `advanced_2.sql`).
*  This directory contains the pizza sales dataset (e.g., in CSV or SQL format).
* `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the repository.
